```

### State Management:
- Use React Context for authentication
- Use React Context or props for data (leads, clients, quotations, invoices, tickets)
- Generate unique IDs using: `Date.now()` or simple counter

### Key Functions to Implement:
```javascript
// Auto-generate numbers
generateQuotationNumber() // QT-YYYY-###
generateInvoiceNumber()   // INV-YYYY-###
generateTicketNumber()    // TKT-YYYY-###

// Calculations
calculateQuotationTotal(items, taxRate)
calculateRevenue(invoices)
getLeadConversionRate(leads)

// Status updates
updateLeadStatus(leadId, newStatus)
approveQuotation(quotationId, approverId)
recordPayment(invoiceId, paymentData)
updateTicketStatus(ticketId, newStatus)

// Conversions
convertLeadToClient(leadId)
generateInvoiceFromQuotation(quotationId)

// Activity logging
logActivity(action, entity, userId)
```

## VALIDATION RULES

1. **Email**: Must be valid email format
2. **Phone**: Should contain only numbers and basic formatting
3. **Required Fields**: Show error if empty
4. **Quotation Items**: At least 1 item required, quantity and price must be positive
5. **Payment Amount**: Cannot exceed invoice total
6. **Status Transitions**: 
   - Lead: Can't go from Lost back to other statuses
   - Quotation: Can't edit after approval
   - Invoice: Can't delete if paid

## ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL

Implement these access rules:

1. **Sales Executive**:
   - Can only see and edit leads assigned to them
   - Can create quotations
   - Cannot approve quotations

2. **Sales Manager**:
   - Can see all leads
   - Can approve/reject quotations
   - Cannot generate invoices

3. **Accountant**:
   - Can only see approved quotations
   - Can generate and manage invoices
   - Can record payments
   - Cannot create or edit leads

4. **Engineer**:

   - Can update ticket status and add notes
   - Cannot see financial data

5. **Client**:
   - Can only see their own quotations, invoices, and tickets
   - Read-only access
   - Can create support tickets

6. **Admin**:
   - Full access to everything
